With Azure AD Identity Protection, you are able to:

    Get a consolidated view of flagged users and risk events detected using machine learning algorithms
    Set risk-based Conditional Access policies to automatically protect your users
    Improve security posture by acting on vulnerabilities

The risk event types Azure AD detects include:

Users with leaked credentials: This is done by comparing the credentials, monitoring public and dark web websites, and working with researchers, law enforcement, and security teams at Microsoft and other trusted sources.
Sign-ins from anonymous IP addresses: The service checks sign-ins in real time from an anonymous IP address (for example, Tor browser, anonymizer VPNs). These IP addresses are typically used by attackers who want to hide their login telemetry (IP address, location, device, etc.) for potentially malicious intent.
Impossible travel to atypical locations: This is done with a service that identCJVPS9352Pifies two sign-ins originating from geographically distant locations, where at least one of the locations may also be atypical for the user, given past behavior. The service actually calculates the time it takes to travel between the two locations and how it would be impossible to be in those two locations.

The service ignores obvious "false positives" contributing to the impossible travel conditions, such as VPNs and locations regularly used by other users in the organization. It takes two weeks for the system to learn the user�s behavior.
Sign-ins from unfamiliar locations and from IP addresses with suspicious activity: This is done in real time and is best when used with modern authentication and where basic authentication is disabled.
Sign-ins from infected devices: These are monitored and blocked.

 The vast majority of security breaches take place when attackers gain access to an environment by stealing a user�s identity. 

ach risk detection that has been detected for a sign-in of a user contributes to a logical concept called risky sign-in. A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might not have been performed by the legitimate owner of a user account.

Investigate risky sign-ins and users report							
Risk: 
Insight into risky environment

Recommendations: 
Using the risky sign-ins, risky users, and risk detections reports we can investigate and gain insight into risk in our environment. With the ability to filter and sort the risky sign-ins, users and detections, we can better understand potential intrusion in our organizatio
